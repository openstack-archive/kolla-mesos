"""
Command-line utility to get the IP address from the newest DHCP lease.

It's written for using with vagrant-hostmanager and vagrant-libvirt plugins.
Vagrant-hostmanager by default fetches only IP addresses from eth0 interfaces
on VM-s. Therefore, the first purpose of this utility is to be able to fetch
the address also from the other interfaces.

Libvirt/virsh only lists all DHCP leases for the given network with timestamps.
DHCP leases have their expiration time, but are not cleaned up after destroying
VM. If someone destroys and sets up the VM with the same hostname, we have
many DHCP leases for the same hostname and we have to look up for timestamp.
That's the second purpose of this script.
