Kolla-Mesos's Mission
=====================

Kolla-Mesos provides Mesos deployment of Kolla Docker containers to meet Kolla's mission.

Kolla-Mesos is highly opinionated out of the box, but allows for complete
customization. This permits operators with minimal experience to deploy
OpenStack quickly and as experience grows modify the OpenStack configuration to
suit the operator's exact requirements.

Kolla-Mesos Overview
====================

Note: Kolla-Mesos is at a very early stage of development and the
documentation is currently focused on helping developers understand
the project and get started.
